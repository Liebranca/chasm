# CHASM

General-purpose dump for all my SDL2 boilerpaste needs.

Originally a part of [bitter](https://github.com/Liebranca/bitter), I split it from that project because it'd generate additional dependencies.

Right now, there's not much here. Input-handling functions already exist in my codebase, I just haven't migrated them yet. Soon enough.
